# How To Use
  use [image_scanner] shortcode and the form and assets will only be loaded on that page
## What does it do?
The plugin was designed to take in the image uploaded by client and store it on server and giveout a response on the type of the skin and what they can do to take better care(The responses are random for now)
And then take some info from client to store beside the uploaded image.
Now it also use MediaPipe to check if the uploaded image has an actual face!
